## A Python script that plays dino based on your head orientation

### Ths basic purpose of this script is to perform head tracking, and if the head is moved more than a certain amount to the right (the user's right), then to simply press a spacebar using PyAutoGui, and relase the spacebar (Otherwise, the spacebar just stays pressed. Kinda like a cat on the keyboard). This still needs some refining of the parameters, to get better tracking and ignore unintentional head turns or so.
